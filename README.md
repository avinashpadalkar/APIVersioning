API Versioning
- Why API versioning is required?

  - Requirements changes
  
     Changing the request/response format (e.g. from XML to JSON)

  - Change would break existing software

     Changing a property name (e.g. from name to productName) or data type on a property (e.g. from an integer to a float)

     Adding a required field on the request (e.g. a new required header or property in a request body)

  - Previously available data is removed

     Removing a property on the response (e.g. removing description from a product)

- Versioning Standard

    No versioning standards exist

    Companies set their own standards

- Versioning Strategy
   
    URI path versioning

    URL parameter versioning

    Content Negotiation

    Request Header


 - URI path versioning

    update a version number in URL path

   http://localhost:8080/uri_path_demo/v1/call
   http://localhost:8080/uri_path_demo/v2/call

 - URL parameter versioning

    Version as a query string parameter
   http://localhost:8080/url_parameter_demo/call?api-version=1
   http://localhost:8080/url_parameter_demo/call?api-version=2

 - Content Negotiation

    Versioning with Content-type in the "accept" headerContent negotiation is the process of selecting one of the multiple possible representations to return to a client, based on client or server preferences.http://localhost:8080/CONTENT_NEGOTIATION_DEMO/call 
    Accept:application/vnd.v2+json
    Accept:application/vnd.v3+json
    Accept:application/json
   http://localhost:8080/content_negotiation_demo/call

 - Request Header
   This strategy lets you specify the version by creating custom headers using version numbers. In this API versioning strategy, we donâ€™t need to modify the URL. Versioning gets handled through headers. Also, Its approach is easy to maintain and manageable, It required minimum code-related changes to implement. 
   Custom Header to version API call

   http://localhost:8080/request_header_demo/call

    Headers - X-API-VERSION : 1
    Headers - X-API-VERSION : 2
